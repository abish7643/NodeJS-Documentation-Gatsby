# Node JS

Javascript was literally confined to run on a browser. Node JS made it possible to run Javascript outside a browser using Node JS. Node JS runs on the V8 Engine (Google/Chrome), So literally it's architecture has similarities compared to Javascipt on a browser. Other alternatives to Node JS are Python, Php, Ruby etc (Server Side languages).

> Literally we can use the same language on a server rather thanjust a browser/client

## Computer and Code

1. Node JS
2. C++
3. Machine Code
4. Hardware

V8 engine compiles Javascript into Machine Code. Node.js is written in C++.
